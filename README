* A DPLL-style SAT solver in pure Haskell
Install using the typical Cabal procedure:

$ ./Setup.lhs configure
$ ./Setup.lhs build

This will produce a binary called funsat at ./dist/build/funsat/funsat and a
standalone library interface for the solver.  If you feel like profiling the
code, a profiling binary is automatically built in
./dist/build/funsat-prof/funsat-prof.
