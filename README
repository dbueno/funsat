* A DPLL-style SAT solver in pure Haskell
Install using the typical Cabal procedure:

$ ghc --make -o Setup Setup.hs
$ ./Setup configure
$ ./Setup build

This will produce a binary called funsat at ./dist/build/funsat/funsat and a
standalone library interface for the solver.  If you feel like profiling the
code, uncomment the profiling executable in funsat.cabal, and a profiling
binary will automatically be built in ./dist/build/funsat-prof/funsat-prof.
