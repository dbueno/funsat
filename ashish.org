* What if learned clause only has the first uip in it?  To where do I
backtrack?

Backtrack to the max of the levels of the variables involved in in the learned
clause, excluding the uip.  If that is empty, then undo all decisions.

** -Never- include the uip in the calculation of the backtrack level.

** Backtrack level
If btLevel = k, that means the decision level after backtracking should be k.

* Why does sat terminate?
You don't delete the locked clauses, i.e. those that are the reason for any
propagation.

* I do the right thing to detect unsat; namely, if there's a conflict at
decision level 0.  If it's possible to backtrack, then the problem is not
known to be unsat, since there are some decisions.

* Don't need the bad variables list, because you only delete the locked clauses.

* TODO look at RSAT's strategies
