* 1.2
Reimplemented with lazy ByteStrings, for efficiency.  It used to be very slow
on large CNF instances.

(backwards-incompatible) Now use unboxed int-arrays for clauses, which is more
memory-efficient than lists.

* 1.1 (21 Mar 2008)
Parser allows clauses to be split over multiple lines.

* 1.0.1
Cabal description fix

* 1.0
Initial release
