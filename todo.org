I had to re-install GHC 6.8.1 for a reason that is not important.  I was going
to install 6.8.2, which I had to compile myself.  While waiting for that, I
worked on DPLLSat with 6.8.1.  My tests run in 5 seconds, without
optimisations!  Last night I was waiting 10 minutes.  And this is user time!
I have no idea why.  I did change the unit propagation code today, but only
making it do more work!

I'm going to install 6.8.2, and then put 6.8.1 somewhere else so I can switch
between them easily, somehow.  Weird, weird.

This could be explained by a different test distribution ...

that have actually been made since the last iteration; this saves time.

So unitProp (maybe rename bcp?) should take a list of literals to propagate,
and compute until that list is emptied -- sounds like a worklist algorithm!

and wch fields of the state.  Probably can get away with some watcher.

* DONE [#A] Make watched literals work as follows:
  CLOSED: [2008-02-22 Fri 11:38]
-- watcherMap: Map Lit [((Lit, Lit), Clause)]

** When l first added to assignment (either decision or propagation):
if -l is watched, then for each clause associated with -l, look at -l's paired
literal, q.  If q is undefined under the assignment, then:

  -- If q is a unit literal of this clause, assign q.

  -- If q is *not* a unit literal of this clause, stop watching -l and
starting watching some other literal of the clause.  (Choose next by removing
everything in the assignment from the clause, then picking a random element.)

Write this in terms of a list of newly-assigned literals, so one can recurse
at the end.
